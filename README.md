# Deep Learning algorithms with TensorFlow

This repository is a collection of various Deep Learning algorithms implemented using the
[TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) library. This package is intended as a command line utility you can use to quickly train and
evaluate popular Deep Learning models and maybe use them as benchmark/baseline in comparison to your custom models/datasets.

### Requirements:

* tensorflow >= 0.6 (tested on tensorflow 0.6, 0.7.1 and 0.8)

### List of available models:

* Convolutional Networks
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine
* Deep Belief Network
* Deep Autoencoder
* Denoising Autoencoder
* Stacked Denoising Autoencoder
* MultiLayer Perceptron

### Installation

Through github:

* cd in a directory where you want to store the project, e.g. ``/home/me``
* clone the repository: ``git clone https://github.com/blackecho/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow.git``
* ``cd Deep-Learning-TensorFlow``
* now you can configure the software and run the models (see the [documentation](http://deep-learning-tensorflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))!

### Documentation:

You can find the documentation for this project at this [link](http://deep-learning-tensorflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
